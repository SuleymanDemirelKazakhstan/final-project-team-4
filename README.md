## Goals:
+ The main goal of this project is to make life of our customers easier, by providing the system which will consult them before they will visit the doctor. It will help our clietns to save their time and maybe some money. Nowadays, visiting doctor sometimes takes too long time, and usually after first visit client will take a direction to pass some analysis, and visits him secondary, and of course first and secondary visits will cost some money. Our system(online bot) will be able to consult clients in the first step of visit, I mean bot will ask them some questions, like, what kind of symptoms do they have, and by processing this information will give them direction to needed analysis. And after will show the list of corresponding doctor and shows the work schedule of this doctor, and his available time to visit so that you can make an appointment at the available time.
