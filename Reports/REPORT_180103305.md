## January

First of all I found all team members I would work with and shared roles among themselves, I took a role of the designer. After we created a team we decided to make a Zoom meeting to discuss the project which we would do. Each of us shared their ideas about the project and we tried to choose the best one.

## February

After all the discussions we made, we decided to do a project related to medicine (the idea I came up with). The main idea was to create a bot (at that moment we thought about telegram bot) which will help you to identify your disease and will help to make an appointment with a doctor. 
So we made a research for similar applications and found out that we can do the web based bot application. So I started to create a design of that application (you can see it by the following link https://www.figma.com/file/iI9kcTh32RS7mJOG6mv6MR/Diploma-project-DocBot). I was looking for suitable colors that could be used in our project and decided to choose the following: #1963C6, #ffffff and #000000. Then I tried to create a logo for our bot (you can also see them in the attached link).

## March

After we had a team discussion we came to the conclusion that we will still make a telegram bot and add one landing page and an admin page for the doctors. Landing page containing a basic information about the doctor: his/her specialization, background, available time and cost. Doctor admin page contains information about patients who made an appointment with the specific doctor. So when we met with the team members, me and Sultan started to draw our web designs on the paper and made a sitemap of the two web pages. After that I started to design them on the Figma (link to view our projects design: https://www.figma.com/file/AdWMCo0J4mYbwEPPEgbO3Y/Diploma-landing-page). 
Firstly I started from the landing page - information about doctors. I did the basic design and discussed with Nasiba if she could do it as a front-end. After her approval I started to detail the design and chose the fonts and colors that I used in the design. 
Colors that I used: #000000, #E8EFFF, #434656, #1963C6. 
Fonts that I used: Roboto Condensed bold, Roboto regular and Roboto light.

## April

After I finished the desktop based design I made a mobile version of the website.
After finishing the landing page of the project I started the design of the doctors admin page. It takes more time than the first web design. Nasiba, Anel and Aidana filled the database. That's why I asked them which kind of data they need. Based on their requests, I tweaked what we drew on paper and started building the site on figma. I used the same colors and fonts that were used for the landing page. I also rendered every step that is possible when working on this web page. Made most of the buttons clickable and showed how the interaction between them will be. After that, I sent Nasibe and Anel to start developing the front end and back end. In the process, I made small changes to the design.
