Report #15 Tazhibayeva Aidana

Plan:

1. Find a team
2. Choose my role
3. Share with my ideas
4. Write my part of the project

January:

In the beginning, we created a team of five people. At the same time, we arranged an online meeting and discussed project options. As a result, we came to the conclusion to create a web application for the SDU cantina. Based on the project, we chose our roles. Where my task was to be responsible for the database.

February:

Got access to the GitHub classroom for our team. The roles of all teammates are filled in on Readme.md. For most of February we were busy with the idea of ​​creating a mobile application, which we later abandoned. As a result, we decided to make a project related to medicine. The main idea was to create a bot (at that time we were thinking about a bot for telegrams) that will help you identify your disease and help you make an appointment with a doctor. Therefore, we did some research on similar applications and found out that we can create a web application for bots.

March:

Participated in the discussion of the first steps of our application.
When I got together with the team, I drew the database diagram on a piece of paper and thought out the logic (which collections, how to connect). We needed to create a database with symptoms and diseases for our bot. The symptom database was very difficult to find and thanks to Anela who found the symptom list in English it was easier to move on. Since our bot is in Russian, I translated all the symptoms from English into Russian. Due to the fact that the medicine is vast, it was a little hard not knowing the disease and the correct translation.

April:

Databases with doctors and their specialties were the fastest because we were allowed to use data from A'Clinic. I threw all this data into MongoDB (where the database was created by Nasiba), and connected it together. Due to the fact that some of the data was incorrect, Anel and Nasib were asked to remake them for the site and for the bot. In the end, I finished all the shortcomings that needed to be corrected.
