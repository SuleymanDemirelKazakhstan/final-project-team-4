Report #15 Dyussenova Anel



Plan: 

Find a team, Choose a role for yourself, Choose the technology that I will use  
Attend all meetings and conferences with the team 
Actively participate in the work 
Arrange tasks correctly and allocate time to complete these tasks 
Write my part of the project 



January: 

Firstly, I found a team, and we held a conference at Zoom to discuss what project we would do. I chose the role of a back-end developer. 
We decided to create a mobile application for ios.
 


February: 

For almost the entire February we were engaged in the idea of ​​creating a mobile application, which we later abandoned. We also spent a lot of time on the idea of ​​using a Web bot, which we also abandoned.
I found a database of diseases and related symptoms (in English). 
Analyzed the market for analogues. 
I went to a meeting with the representative of the clinic. 
Participated in the separation and classification of symptoms in order to simplify the process of asking questions to clarify symptoms. 
I suggested using Dialogflow to recognize symptoms in text. By using this option, we were able to avoid the difficulty of asking the right questions to clarify the symptoms. 



March: 

Participated in the discussion of the first steps of our application. 
When I got together with the team, I painted the database diagram on a piece of paper and thought out the logic (which collections how to connect). 
Set up a project using npm (a package manager for the JavaScript programming language). Also added a .gitignore file. 
Dealt with Dialogflow. Practiced using it. 
I wrote synonyms for symptoms to train the model to identify symptoms in the text. Created Entity Symptom. 
Connected Dialogflow with Telegram Bot. 
Connected Dialogflow with code. Configured sending Webhooks from Dialogflow to ngrok. I have configured and am using ngrok. We will use it temporarily then we will go to the server. Created an Intent in Dialogflow that would catch and recognize symptoms. I cleaned the data and converted it into Onehot Vector format, where each symptom is a separate parameter. 
Trained two models: NaiveBayes and DecisionTree.



April: 

Created several Intents that collect basic information about the user, such as: Name Surname Patronymic, age, gender and phone number. Created Yes and No Intents to validate the entered information. This step took me a long time because I made mistakes in the architecture of the conversation. I made an Intents followup, which was a mistake, then I had to completely delete and rebuild. But before deleting, I spent time fixing this error using followupEvent, which did not give the expected results. 
I prescribed the bot to check if the user has already entered basic information to Bot. 
Wrote a get route that sends information about a doctor and his specializations to DoctorProfile. 
Created an intent that asks how he can help the user (Symptoms, List of doctors, History) 
Created an intent that is triggered when a person asks for a list of doctors. And Bot returns to User the list of specializations, which code takes from the Atlas Mongodb database. Followup intent that takes a specialization and gets all doctors with such a specialty and sends the user links to the profile page of these doctors. 
Created an intent that retrieves the history of user visits, if any exist
Integrated Decision Tree model which was already pre-trained. I chose the Decision Tree algorithm because it has better accuracy. I wrote a code to translate the symptoms transmitted by the bot into a Onehot vector. 
I wrote routes for the Doctor's Personal Account, which, in general, return information about visits and patients.
