<b>Plan:</b>

1. Find a team, Choose a role , Choose the technology that I will use</br>  
2. Attend all meetings and conferences with the team </br>
3. Actively participate in the work </br>
4. Arrange tasks correctly and allocate time to complete these tasks </br>
5. Write my part of the project </br>



<b>January: </b>

Firstly, I found a team, and we held a conference at Zoom to discuss what project we would do. I chose the role of a back-end developer. </br>
We decided to create a mobile application for ios.</br>
 


<b>February: </b>

For almost the entire February we were engaged in the idea of creating a mobile application, which we later abandoned. We also spent a lot of time on the idea of using a Web bot, which we also abandoned.</br>
I found a database of diseases and related symptoms (in English). </br>
Analyzed the market for analogues. </br>
I went to a meeting with the representative of the clinic. </br>
Participated in the separation and classification of symptoms in order to simplify the process of asking questions to clarify symptoms. </br>
I suggested using Dialogflow to recognize symptoms in text. By using this option, we were able to avoid the difficulty of asking the right questions to clarify the symptoms. </br>



<b>March: </b>

Participated in the discussion of the first steps of our application.</br> 
When I got together with the team, I painted the database diagram on a piece of paper and thought out the logic (which collections how to connect). </br>
Set up a project using npm (a package manager for the JavaScript programming language). Also added a .gitignore file. </br>
Dealt with Dialogflow. Practiced using it. </br>
I wrote synonyms for symptoms to train the model to identify symptoms in the text. Created Entity Symptom.</br> 
Connected Dialogflow with Telegram Bot. </br>
Connected Dialogflow with code. Configured sending Webhooks from Dialogflow to ngrok. I have configured and am using ngrok. We will use it temporarily then we will go to the server. Created an Intent in Dialogflow that would catch and recognize symptoms. I cleaned the data and converted it into Onehot Vector format, where each symptom is a separate parameter. </br>
Trained two models: NaiveBayes and DecisionTree.</br>



<b>April: </b>

Created several Intents that collect basic information about the user, such as: Name Surname Patronymic, age, gender and phone number. Created Yes and No Intents to validate the entered information. This step took me a long time because I made mistakes in the architecture of the conversation. I made an Intents followup, which was a mistake, then I had to completely delete and rebuild. But before deleting, I spent time fixing this error using followupEvent, which did not give the expected results.</br> 
I prescribed the bot to check if the user has already entered basic information to Bot. </br>
Wrote a get route that sends information about a doctor and his specializations to DoctorProfile. </br>
Created an intent that asks how he can help the user (Symptoms, List of doctors, History) </br>
Created an intent that is triggered when a person asks for a list of doctors. And Bot returns to User the list of specializations, which code takes from the Atlas Mongodb database. Followup intent that takes a specialization and gets all doctors with such a specialty and sends the user links to the profile page of these doctors. </br>
Created an intent that retrieves the history of user visits, if any exist</br>
Integrated Decision Tree model which was already pre-trained. I chose the Decision Tree algorithm because it has better accuracy. I wrote a code to translate the symptoms transmitted by the bot into a Onehot vector. </br>
I wrote routes for the Doctor's Personal Account, which, in general, return information about visits and patients. </br>
