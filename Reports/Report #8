Report of Week#8


We faced the difficulty of correctly posing questions to clarify symptoms in a person and decided that the bot's telegram
functionality would not allow us to do what we had in mind. Therefore, we decided that we will make a web bot.

Dikanbayeva Assura: Designed the bot https://www.figma.com/file/iI9kcTh32RS7mJOG6mv6MR/Diploma-project-DocBot?node-id=0%3A1
 
Sultan Aitkali, Dyussenova Anel and Valiyeva Nassiba:
We studied a database of symptoms and diseases. Also divided the symptoms into groups in order to minimize the number of questions.
For example, so that the bot does not display a huge list of symptoms to choose from at the first question,
we decided that with each question we should narrow the range of probable symptoms to choose from.
   
Tazhibayeva Aidana: started translating the database with symptoms and diseases into Russian:
