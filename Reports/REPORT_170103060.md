January:

First step was to create a team, we created a team of five peoples, and divided our roles, I volunteered to be a project manager, because I am working as a project manager. So after first two meetings, we decided to create an application for sdu canteen.  

February:

Got the access to the Github account of our team, to create and upload our reprositories. We started the creation process of design, and discussed about how will it look like, how canteens will be divided in application, where will we find the menus, and so on. After a few meetings, we decided to change our project to another, which is more complex, and useful. This project is for some clinic, there will be two parts, first is telegram bot, which will collect the information about a patient, and helps to make online appointment, and also, there will be another platform, mean website, where you can see the information about doctor and his schedule, and so on.

March:

We organized a live meeting, where discussed the main questions related to the project:
-"What kind of information will telegram bot collect?"
-"How to connect telegram bot and website, how user will cross over from telegram bot to the website?"
-"What will contain our website?"
-"Do we have design preferences?"
-"How will we create database and which tools will use to predict diagnos"
-"Where will we find the information about doctors, or will we use some example doctors?"
Some of these questions were resolved there, some of them postponed to later. We resolved them by the priority, the most important ones was solved first, secondaries a bit later.
