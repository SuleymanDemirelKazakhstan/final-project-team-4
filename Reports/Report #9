Report of Week#9

All:
We tried to formulate all the questions correctly, but medicine is too extensive a science, 
and we do not have a sufficient level of knowledge in it. Therefore, it was very difficult to systematize
the symptoms and it was impossible to always ask the questions in the same order, since each case and each 
disease may contain different explanations from the doctor. Anel found another solution to our problem: 
use Dialogflow as nlp for text recognition. Now we can directly ask what symptoms a person has, 
and he will be able to write himself what worries him, and Dialogflow will recognize his text. 
And now the telegram bot functionality is completely suitable for us and we decided to switch to it.
 
Valieva Nasiba: Created a database and collections in Mongo Atlas for everyone.

Tazhibayeva Aidana: completed the translation of the symptom database, completed the doctors and specializations in our database
 
Dussenova Anel: created the "Symptom" Entity in the dialogue flow, filled in the data of symptoms and 
their synonyms to train the dialogue flow to correctly recognize symptoms
 
Dikanbaeva Assura: started designing the landing page: Doctor's profile, where was the main information about doctors (their names, specializations, background,
availible time and price)
 
Aitkali Sultan: Controlled the whole process, synchronized results with the plan. Hepled to Assura with design.
