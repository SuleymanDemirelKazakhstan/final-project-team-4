<b>January:</b>

First of all, I found a team (actually the team found me :) ) Then we held a conference at Zoom to discuss what project we would do. I chose the role of a front-end developer. We decided to create a mobile application for IOS. I was going to use swift.


<b>February:</b>

Access GitHub classroom for our team. Filled in the roles of all teammates in Readme.md. This month I was looking for similar projects and discussed design with others. I presented my ideas on how the mobile application will work and look.
When we changed the project with the team to a web application with a telegram bot, I changed the stack. I decided to choose MERN - (mongo, express, react.js, node.js), since I have already worked with it.


<b>March: </b>

Participated in all discussions of the steps of our web application. When I got together with the team, I painted the database diagram on a piece of paper and thought out the logic (which collections there will be and how to connect them with each other). I negotiated with Assura (the designer) about what is feasible for me in the front and what is not. Then I was waiting for the design. While waiting I created a database and created collections from our diagram in mongo atlas. I decided to use a cloud database instead of a local one so that everyone could go into it and fill in the data. Then I gave everyone access to the Mongo Atlas.
As soon as I got the design in Figma, I started working on it. Set up a project using npm (a package manager for the JavaScript programming language) Created separate folders for backend and frontend (each folder has its own folders and libraries, added a .gitignore file in both). I downloaded the library called concurrently, so that I can run the back and front with one command. The command: ‘npm run dev’ should be run in the Project folder. I decided what routes would be at the front. Organized folders and files for convenience and code readability.


<b>April:</b>

Once a week I met with Anel (backend developer) and made up tasks for myself in trello.
I cloned the github repository and made the first commit ,then pushed it. Started with the first page: Doctor's profile. Here are some tasks about this page from trello:
find library for stars (rating), scrollable timetable, add get request to get information about doctor and fill the entire page with that information, make pop-up window with button 'Sign up for this time'. When I got the mobile version, I added responsiveness and changed the arrangement of some elements. I used the popular React UI framework called Material-UI. When the page with the doctor's personal cabinet was ready, I made the login page. We decided that doctors will be given their passwords, so they don't need to register. I store the session in the local storage of the browser. On the page of the personal cabinet there is a calendar, a carousel with patients who have not yet been admitted, but have been registered to a doctor. I have been looking for a calendar library for a very long time. Here are some tasks on this page from trello: make a login page for doctors to access their admin page, make a calendar with tabs (today, tomorrow, week, month), make a second block as a carousel, add two lists.
I used the axios library for requests to the back. In react, I used the useEffect, useState, useParams, useHistory hooks. Also I helped Anel to write several routes needed for the front: post login - (login and password) -> return token, post saveVisit - saves visit (status not confirmed, user_id from params, get time and day from card, symptoms from another collection, recept default blank ), post confirmVisit (with analyzes and comment) - send to user in telegram, get getConfirmedVisits - get visits with doctor id (for calendar), get getNotConfirmedVisits - get visits with doctor id (for rest page).
